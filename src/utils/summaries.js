export const our_fee_description = "Our fee is structured so we only make money if you make more than you would have made without us helping you get the AOTC. So we take 20% of the refund you get due to the AOTC up to $200. If you get no refund, we take no money! Our real goal with all of this is to start putting students in position to game the system in the same way so many adults do. ";

export const taxable_income_description = "The total amount of money you made last year is called your \"Gross Income\" and your gross income minus any deductions you qualify for (like the standard deduction and potentially some tuition and fees ones) is equal to your taxable income. This is the amount the government uses to decide what tax bracket to put you in and how much you owe. ";

export const effective_tax_rate_description = "Since the United States has a Progressive (not Democrat) Tax System, the first $10,000 you make are tax different than the next $10,000. As you make more money, the money you make keeps getting taxed more, and therefore there is no specific tax rate that you are taxed at and instead a collection of tax rates. We average them and give you a flat number that makes it a bit easier to understand.";

export const tax_bill_description = "This is how much you \"owe\" the government before taking into account what you may have already paid and if you have any credits.";

export const withholdings_description = "Your withholdings are what the companies you may have worked for kept out for tax purposes on their end. If you received a W2 form in January, your employer definitely withheld money. Usually, for lower income folks, companies generally end up over paying on behalf of you, meaning you can get a good bit back come refund time. ";

export const credits_description = "Credits are things that directly subtract from your Tax Bill, so if you owe $2,000 in taxes but have a $2,500 credit, you actually now owe ($2,000 - $2,500) = -$500, so you get back $500. The best credit that most students can receive is the American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC) which is a $2,500 credit. Almost 40% of eligible students didn't claim the credit last year. That's a LOT of money left on the table.";

export const net_refund_description = "If you gave the government more than you owed them throughout the year, your net refund is the total amount of money that you'd expect from the government. If you owe money than this means you didn't pay enough through the year and you owe the government a bit more.";
